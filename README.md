# Watershed
Implementation of the waterhed segmentation in C
To compile, type gcc main.c -o watershed 
To execute, type ./watershed -grey avion(or another folder containig images) to obtain the results of the algorithm in grayscale or
                 ./watershed -color avion(or another folder containig images) to obtain the results of the algorithm with colors or
                 ./watershed -contour avion(or another folder containig images) to obtain the results of the algorithm highlighting the contour of objects
